<h3>Open Austin Monthly Events:</h3>
<p>If you have an interest in improving our city through the use of data, technology, and design there is space for
  you. We encourage folks of all backgrounds and skill level to join us at our events to contribute their ideas and
  expertise. </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Community Action Night</b> - Coming to a Community Action Night is the easiest way to get started with Open
    Austin. First we do introductions and announcements. Then we invite people to pitch projects and discussion ideas.
    From there, folks break out into groups and get to work. Newbies will get onboarded with Civic Hacking 101 and
    food and drinks are provided.</li>
  <li><b>Open Gov & Civic Tech Meetup</b> - A monthly meetup for anyone interested in learning more about the growing
    Open Government and Civic Technology movement in Austin. From lightning talks to workshops, expect a wide variety
    of topics that intersect data, design, technology, and government.</li>
</ul>
