<br /><br />**Designing for Civic Solutions** is a one-day workshop and collaboration between Open Austin and Austin Center for Design (AC4D) alumni to teach community members how to use a human-centered design process to focus on social impact.

Workshop attendees will engage in ethnographic research, synthesis, and rapid ideation centered on the theme of “mobility in Austin”. They will be empowered to use these skills to research, design, and prototype other civic tech and social good projects important to them and their surrounding communities. To learn this process they will form small groups focusing on different aspects of mobility in Austin around the Rundberg neighborhood.

The event will be free and open to the public. No design or development skills are necessary to attend this workshop.

### Goals for this workshop
Upon completion of the workshop, Participants will learn how to:

- Contribute their research and ideas to the existing pressing issue of mobility in Austin
- Conduct human-centered research around the theme of mobility
- Translate their research into meaningful insights
- Practice ideation methods based on their insights from the field
- Use storyboarding as a way to prototype ideas
- Apply this process and these skills to future projects
