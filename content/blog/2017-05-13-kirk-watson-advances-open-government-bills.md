The [Texas Tribune has reported](https://www.texastribune.org/2017/05/11/texas-senate-unticks-proposals-plug-public-records-loopholes/) that Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, has attached several open government initiatives to a single bill designated [HB 2328](http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill=HB2328), which has passed the Texas Senate. The amended bill now goes back to the House for its approval. The provisions now attached to HB 2328 include:

* getting rid of the requirement for a governmental body to get an attorney general opinion before withholding information under the Public Information Act, if it makes a good faith determination that an exception applies.

* changing the Public Information Act’s exception for contract bids, so that the exception doesn’t apply once a contract is awarded.

* including some contractors in the definition of a “governmental body” obligated to respond to record requests.

* mandating public access to government information stored on privately-owned accounts and devices.

* providing that public records containing dates of birth can still be disclosed.

* creating a procedure for the Attorney General to compel a response to a public records request.
