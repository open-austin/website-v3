<p>All year, volunteers from Open Austin have been working on<a title="Gihub issues" href="https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas" rel="nofollow"> Civic Tech projects</a>. Needs in the community were identified and researched at the Code Across Austin event in February. Teams formed around projects at the City-sponsored ATX Hack for Change in June. And throughout the year, we've hosted monthly Civic Hack Nights to push our projects forward.</p>
<p><strong>The Ship It Weekend is our final major event of the year!</strong><br />
<strong>The focus will be on existing projects that just need that last little push.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All skills and experience levels are welcome.<br />
</strong>Maybe you haven't done any "civic hacking" but you want to get involved with a project that could have a real impact in our community. We'll need help with design, development, user testing, field research, marketing, photography, writing, policy expertise and probably more.</p>
<p>Join us as we push forward on <a href="https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues" target="_blank">various projects </a> that have been started throughout the year. Come celebrate a great year of civic hacking in Austin and let's Ship It!</p>
