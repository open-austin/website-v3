When Open Austin was founded in 2009, [Obama's open data initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/open) was just getting started. A few years later in 2012, Code for America [announced it would send its Fellows](http://kut.org/post/what-can-code-america-do-austin) to inject tech talent into local government, including Austin as a pilot city. Five years ago, the White House recognized the first weekend in June as the [National Day of Civic Hacking](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/06/03/open-data-and-innovation-national-day-civic-hacking-2016), an event we co-present annually as the [ATX Hack for Change](http://atxhackforchange.org/).

In the eight years since our founding, the world is a different place.

It is interesting to juxtapose the history of Open Austin, and the larger national "Civic Tech" movement, with the presidential timeline. It reminds us just how young this work is. In 2017, our organization is experiencing its first presidential transition.

Our 45th President, Donald J Trump, was inaugurated in DC last week. We'd like to reflect on highlights from 2016. Then we will lay out  our focus ahead for 2017.

## 2017

Since the Election of Donald J. Trump, we've seen an increased hunger from our community for projects and advocacy work that promotes the civic good. We believe the intersection of technology & government are vital for progress in our experiment in democracy.

As an all-volunteer organization, we labored to accomplish the achievements listed above. This year, we want to deepen our impact and try harder to support existing organizations in our community.

In order to do this, our coreteam has chosen three internal projects and we'd like your help with it.

[**Apply here to join our coreteam**](https://openaustin.typeform.com/to/zyE0a4)

1. Membership Development Plan
  - We want to make it easier for volunteers to assume roles within the organization, on projects, and in planning. We want to accommodate varying levels of availability.
  - We brainstormed about our org model and decided it looks most like a snowflake ❄️. We invite you to imagine where you could plug in.

2. Values
  - We know that if we want to fight hard battles in the next 4 years, we need to stand on a principled foundation.
  - At our meetup in November 2016, we facilitated a collaborative design exercise to find language that describes the core values of Civic Tech.
  - Then we distilled these insights into a better reflection of Why we do our work.
  - The tangible outcome will be an updated About Page _(coming v soon)_.

3. Official Partner Projecets (aka: Open Austin Labs)
  - We want to get better and support projects that have:
      - Formal partnerships with external stakeholders (like other non-profits or the City of Austin)
      - Clear goals and deadlines
      - Opportunities for funding via grants, contracts, etc.
      - A plan for open-source maintenance and documentation.

But most importantly, we want to remain a friendly community where people come to learn, share, and collaborate with each other. We will need your help.

Please consider joining our snowflake ❄️❄️❄️
