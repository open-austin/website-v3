### Collaboration seeks to bring design methodology to civic tech in Austin

**Austin, TX:** Open Austin, a volunteer-driven civic tech organization, will host a one-day workshop on Saturday, April 23rd. The workshop is a day of collaboration between Open Austin and [Austin Center for Design (AC4D)](ac4d.com) alumni to teach community members how human-centered design improves social impact when working on civic projects. The workshop is being held at Little Walnut Creek Library at 835 West Rundberg Lane. The event is free and open to the public and attendees must [register via Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/designing-for-civic-solutions-workshop-tickets-24534044989).

The theme of the workshop is designing for “Mobility in Austin”. The focus will be on transportation issues in the area. "As mobility discussions are happening all over the city, Open Austin presents a unique model for working collaboratively to solve a community's pressing mobility challenges," said Daniela Nuñez, Co-Vice President of the Georgian Acres Neighborhood Association. Nuñez will be giving a short presentation to workshop attendees about the the history of the area and the issues that are most prominent.

“I believe events like this are important steps towards future collaboration between community leaders, designers, technologists, and interested citizens.” said Eric Boggs, AC4D Alumni Coordinator and host facilitator. “If we’re going to do anything truly innovative or useful beyond the status quo to address our civic issues, it will take a shared understanding of what problem needs solving and for whom. Human Centered Design can provide that framework.”

Through this collaboration the Open Austin hopes attendees will contribute research and ideas to existing issues of mobility in Austin. Furthermore, the workshop will give attendees the opportunity to learn human-centered design research methodologies, and empower attendees with new skills and knowledge to apply to current and future projects. Donations from local organizations Austin CityUp, HubCiti, Austin B-Cycle, USAA, and IBM Design helped make this event possible.
