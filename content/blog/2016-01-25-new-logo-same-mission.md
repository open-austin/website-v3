<p><strong>It's 2016 and Open Austin is starting the year with a brand new logo.</strong></p>
<p>With the same mission and a more robust member base, Open Austin hopes to continue to grow and provide space for conversation and connection around civic tech and open government in Austin, Texas.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Why the Change?</strong></p>
<p>Our previous logo was designed by our volunteers and has served us well since it was introduced. It provided a symbol for members and supporters to rally under. It portrayed Open Austin as a group for coders and hackers with the open and closing tags, which is a common motif among Code for America brigades.</p>
<p>As we reexamined our goals and mission, we decided we could design something to better reflect the priorities of Open Austin to be <strong>an inclusive environment for all citizens</strong> that want to work to <strong>make Austin better</strong> using <strong>open data, design, and technology</strong>.</p>
<p>With new colors, we display the boldness, energy, and innovation that the organization fosters. With the new font, we mirror the friendly nature of our participants. And with the the new logo, we capture the diversity, enthusiasm, and professionalism of our organization. The star acknowledges our location in the capital city of lone star state. We include a closing bracket as a cornerstone component of the star, because coding is still an essential part of what we do. But it is not the only way our volunteers contribute.</p>
<p>We want Open Austin to be open not only to self described programmers and hackers, but also to designers, data analysts, policy wonks, non-profit champions, social activists, public servants, students and normal citizens. Through our events, we want all our participants to realize their inner "civic hacker," but we acknowledge that the term "hacker" can exclude people we intend to attract. Openness is essential to our mission.</p>
<p><strong>We are citizens working together to make a better Austin. And as we move forward we hope that you join us.</strong></p>
