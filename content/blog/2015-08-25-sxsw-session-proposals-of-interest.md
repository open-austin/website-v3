<p>In 2012, Code for America founder <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/author/jen/">Jen Pahlka</a> was invited to to <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive">SXSW Interactive</a> give a <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2401594,00.asp">keynote address</a>.

<p>Currently, SXSW is soliciting public input on session proposals through their <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/">Panel Picker</a> tool. You can vote a proposal up (or down) to show your support (or not), as well as leave comments. Registration is required, but it's free. Even if you haven't registered to attend the event, you can participate in the panel picker.</p>
<p>We'd like to highlight some of the sessions of interest that we know about.</p>
