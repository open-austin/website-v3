Open Austin has a new project to support the Austin/Travis County Census 2020 Complete Count Committee. Open Austin volunteers are invited to help [build a microsite](https://github.com/cityofaustin/census2020) to support the Complete Count efforts leading up to Census Day, April 1, 2020. The microsite will build on the [city demographer's map of potentially hard-to-count neighborhoods](https://github.com/cityofaustin/census2020/blob/master/data/Potential_Low_Response_Scores_Travis_Co_2020.pdf) to help direct volunteer efforts where they can contribute most to awareness and trust of the census process. To get involved, find an open issue on the [Github issues list](https://github.com/cityofaustin/census2020/issues) or join the discussion on the #p-census2020 channel of the [Open Austin Slack organization](http://slack.open-austin.org/).
