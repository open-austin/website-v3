OpenStreetMap is a collaborative map of the world that is free to edit and use.
This project focuses on importing building and address data published by the
City of Austin into OpenStreetMap. The OpenStreetMap dataset serves as a basis
for many open mapping projects, so importing high-quality data like this means
Austin will look better on maps and work better for services that do things like
navigation and geolocation.

The basic outline of the project is:

1. Download the data from the City of Austin and convert it into a format that
 can be imported into OpenStreetMap
1. A team of volunteers uploads the transformed data into OpenStreetMap, one
 neighborhood at a time
1. A thorough quality control check on the data to validate and fix any issues
 with the import (currently in-progress)
