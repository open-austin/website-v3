*****************

Liberate Appraisal Data is an effort to open up the Travis County Appraisal District (TCAD) appraisal roll data. The annual appraisal roll consists of valuations of every parcel in the county, and includes details about the age and square footage of property improvements, the size and value of lots, jurisdictional taxing authorities, and much more.
